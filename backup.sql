It is believed to have arrived with ship’s ballast water\r\nNow widespread in Northland as a serious weed of waterways and cropping land. Common in Auckland waterways and there are several infestations in a range of habitats in the Waikato.\r\nEcology\r\n\r\nLow-growing herb that grows very quickly in summer\r\nMats may extend for 15 m over the water surface and become so robust they can support the weight of a person\r\nTends to be more prostrate on land, developing a very deep root system\r\nDoes not produce viable seed, so reproduction is only vegetative\r\nFrost and ice kill exposed stems and leaves, but  protected stems can survive to support the next season’s growth\r\nResponds to high levels of nutrients and withstands some salinity in flowing brackish water.','As a terrestrial weed it grows rapidly, particularly under warm, wet conditions, and can out-compete crops and pastures\r\nAlligator weed will take up heavy metals from the soil and is known to be toxic to some livestock\r\nAquatic alligator weed can rapidly spread in streams and drainage canals, clogging them with vegetation and trapping sediments, thus increasing risk of flooding\r\nIn natural wetland areas alligator weed is a threat to native flora and fauna and is extremely difficult to eradicate once established in such a habitat\r\nAlligator weed is listed in the National Pest Plant Accord and it is therefore illegal to propagate and knowingly spread this plant.','Ensure that alligator weed fragments are not carried on vehicles or equipment\r\nFarmers should protect their properties by:\r\ninsisting all contractors clean their equipment before entering the farm\r\nensuring supplementary feed brought onto the farm is weed free\r\nensuring aggregates, soil and sand brought onto the farm are weed free\r\nTo prevent the spread of alligator weed and other aquatic weeds such as didymo, boat operators should clean their boats and trailers when leaving waterways.'),(28,'weed','Amaranth','Amaranthus powellii, or Amaranthus retroflexus, Amaranthus deflexus, Amaranthus lividus, Amaranthus graecizans, Amaranthus viridis','Eleven species of amaranth have been found in New Zealand, all introduced from tropical or subtropical regions. Some species were cultivated as ornamental garden plants and have then escaped. Others are limited in their distribution\r\nAll species grow as weeds in dry places, around towns and cities and especially in waste places and near docks and rail yards. Some are also serious weeds of summer crops, notably maize\r\nOriginating from warm countries, amaranths tend to germinate in late spring, grow and flower in the summer. Almost all of the species found here are annual species and die after flowering or with the first frosts\r\nAmaranths are C4 plants, meaning that their photosynthesis pathways produce 4-carbon sugars rather than 3-carbon sugars. They can tolerate warmer and drier conditions than our winter-growing species.\r\nRedroot (Amaranthus powellii or Amaranthus retroflexus)\r\nThese two species have often been confused in New Zealand\r\nAmaranthus powellii is common or abundant in both North and South Islands, in waste and cultivated land particularly close to built-up areas\r\nAmaranthus retroflexus grows in similar habits and is particularly common in the South Island and in parts of the North Island\r\nBoth species are more or less hairy, 80-100 cm tall although small plants of both species grow in impoverished places. Stems are red towards the base (hence the common name)\r\nThe best way to distinguish the two species is the shape of the apex of the female tepals: Amaranthus powellii tepals are very unequal and end in sharp tips; Amaranthus retroflexus tips are blunt. In addition Amaranthus retroflexus has short lateral branches of the inflorescence densely arranged up the main spike, whilst in Amaranthus powellii the lateral branches form towards the base\r\nAmaranthus powellii has been found to be responsible for nitrate poisoning in cattle; Amaranthus retroflexus is known to be responsible for poisoning pigs in the United States, but not in New Zealand\r\nBoth species used as vegetables in their native countries.\r\nProstrate amaranth (Amaranthus deflexus)\r\nAbundant from the Waikato southwards but less common further north. Also common in Nelson, Marlborough, north and central Canterbury, but less southwards to Otago. Grows in waste places, in particular on shingle or gravel and around settled areas. It is becoming increasingly common in crops, especially under irrigation\r\nStems tend to lie on the ground, turning upwards at the ends, forming large leafy mats. Leaves are up to 5 cm long on long stalks. Flower head a terminal spike, with the lower lateral branches having short lateral spikes in the upper leaf axils. Stems and flower heads often tan or brown in colour, leaves occasionally with whitish ‘V’ shaped marking\r\nFound in New Zealand first in 1896, probably arriving by accident from tropical America.\r\nPurple amaranth (Amaranthus lividus)\r\nScattered throughout the North Island, especially in towns and cities in warmer areas.. Grows in waste places and cultivated areas but is not very common. Rare in the north of the South Island\r\nStems tend to lie along the ground. Leaves with slender petioles (stalks) which are about half the length of the leaf blades. Flower head a terminal spike, with short lateral spikes in the axils of the upper leaves. In New Zealand the flower heads are mostly bright green in colour whereas in Australia they are usually purple (hence the name)\r\nFirst recorded in New Zealand in 1870, originating in tropical and sub-tropical species, where it is widespread.\r\nMat amaranth (Amaranthus graecizans)\r\nAn annual species, found in Auckland City and Dargaville, and around the East Cape, but most common in Central Otago. Grows in dry stony or gravelly waste places on roadsides and riverbanks\r\nPlants are erect or spreading, much branched, hairless or almost, and up to 80 cm high. Flower heads are greenish, forming clusters in the axils of nearly all leaves\r\nFound in New Zealand first in 1944, probably introduced from tropical Africa or the Mediterranean.\r\nGreen amaranth (Amaranthus viridis)\r\nThe most common amaranth in the tropical South Pacific and only found in New Zealand north of the Bay of Plenty, growing in crops and on sand dunes\r\nA sprawling or partly erect annual plant up to 40 cm high, not very hairy except on the young stems\r\nFirst observed in New Zealand in 1867.\r\nSimilar but less common species\r\nFive other species of Amaranthus have been found in New Zealand, but one of these – Amaranthus spinosus ­– has only been recorded once and is not naturalised. The other species are Amaranthus albus (tumbleweed amaranth), found in and near Napier in the North Island and in Nelson and Christchurch, usually around docks and railway yards, especially where ballast has been dumped. Amaranthus caudatus (love-lies-bleeding) is a garden escape common in and around Christchurch and elsewhere in scattered locations. Easily recognised by its long, drooping, lime green or crimson-coloured, flower heads. It has rough-hairy leaves, leafy stems and beaked seeds and is sometimes common on roadsides and waste places in a few areas of North and South Islands. Amaranthus cruentus is widespread in the tropics as a crop used for its grain. It is tall-growing annual with spikes of dark pink flowers. In New Zealand it has been found growing wild near Masterton and at Rangiora, Lincoln and Waimate in Canterbury. Amaranthus hybridus has two recognised varieties here, one of which, var. erythrostachys, known as prince’s feather, is sometimes found as a garden plant and has escaped in a few places as a weed. It has crimson flowers. The other, var. hybridus, occurs only in a few places like parts of Auckland, Thames, and Mangatahi in Hawkes Bay.','Origin\r\nAll the species of Amaranthus originated in tropical and subtropical countries, some in North and Central America, some in Europe and Asia\r\nOf the eleven species recorded from New Zealand most have been accidentally introduced in ballast or in seed or other vegetable matter from warm zones. Two or three species arrived in New Zealand as ornamental garden plants and have then escaped into the wild.\r\nLife cycle\r\nMost of the species found in New Zealand are annuals but one or two species can persist as short-lived perennials, especially in frost-free places\r\nBeing from the tropics or subtropics all species are sensitive to and killed by frosts.\r\nBenefits\r\nSome species are used as ornamental garden plants and some are grown for their grain production\r\nMany species of amaranth are cultivated as vegetables, for grain production or for animal food in warmer countries.','Impact on crops\r\nRedroot in particular is a common weed of maize, mostly because it grows as the same time as the crop, but also because it grows quickly and can form large, aggressive plants, potentially at high densities\r\nProstrate amaranth is also found in some maize crops but is more common on lower growing vegetable and forage crops\r\nRedroot and other species also often establish in orchards, in the bare, sprayed strip between the crop rows.\r\nImpact on grazing animals\r\nSome species of amaranth contain high levels of oxalates and, under certain conditions contain high levels of nitrate. Many poisonings of livestock in New Zealand are associated with high nitrate levels in redroot.','Grazing management\r\nLivestock readily graze amaranth. Therefore, care is required when nitrate levels might be high.\r\nMowing management\r\nMowing plants taller than the crop, or where no desirable plants are present will give some control and may reduce seed production.\r\nManagement by cultivation\r\nIn cropping cultivation can be used to gain control, but these species tend to emerge at the same time as maize crops. Stale seed bed methods can be effective for later sown crops.\r\nChemical control\r\nRedroot and other amaranth species are susceptible to most herbicides that do not affect the crop. In maize atrazine, acetochlor, mesotrione, nicosulfuron and topramezone are often used\r\nIn orchards or waste spaces glyphosate or glufosinate can both give good control\r\nIf using chlorsulfuron in cereals, amaranth seedlings should be treated when small\r\nTrifluralin, applied and incorporated before the crop is sown, is effective\r\nSome commonly used herbicides like clopyralid or ioxynil will not control these species.'),(35,'pest','Black beetle larvae','Heteronychus arator','Black beetle is a pest in northern North Island\r\nWarm years favour black beetle populations\r\nBoth beetles and larvae damage pasture, other agricultural and some horticultural crops\r\nLarvae cause damage to pasture in summer\r\nAdult beetles cause damage in autumn and spring','Black beetle is an African species but has been present in New Zealand for several decades. It is at the limit of its climatic tolerance and is restricted to Waikato and Bay of Plenty northwards with a southward coastal extension into northern Taranaki and Gisborne. Black beetle outbreaks occur sporadically and follow above average spring temperatures. It has a high temperature requirement for most life processes. Female longevity, number of eggs produced, egg viability, larval survival, growth rate and the amount they eat are all favoured by temperatures greater than 20°C and are severely inhibited at between 10-15°C.\r\nAdult beetles are a characteristic glossy black and about 15 mm long with females being larger than males. They are usually found in the top 1 cm of soil. They undergo extensive dispersal flights in spring and autumn but surface air temperatures must be above 17°C for flights to occur. The eggs, about 2 mm long and ovoid to spherical in shape, are laid singly in soil, close to the surface, in spring.\r\nThe creamy white C shaped larvae, usually found in the top 10 cm of soil, appear superficially like common grass-grub but are larger reaching 2.5 cm when fully grown. These fully grown larave are present and cause damage in summer. In black beetle areas any grass-grub larvae present will be very small (less than 10 mm) at the same time of year. Black beetle larvae can also be distinguished from grass-grub by breathing pores (spiracles) that occur down the length of the body. In grass-grub these are not obvious but in black beetle they are prominent and show clearly as orange spots. Like grass-grub the larvae pass through 3 stages before pupating and emerging as adults. Pupation occurs in February/March and the beetles overwinter. These beetles will not lay eggs until the following spring.','The beetles and larvae of black beetle feed on several pasture grasses including annual ryegrasses, perennial ryegrasses, tall fescue, paspalum and kikuyu. Grasses with high carbohydrate levels in their roots favour adult development and ultimately the size of the populations that develop.\r\nlarval feeding is on roots often close to the surface. In severe infestations the turf can be rolled back owing to the destruction of the root system. In less severe cases the pastures can become clover dominated as legumes are not a favoured food source, or they can become open and susceptible to weed invasion. Damage to pastures from larvae can appear similar to common grass-grub but occurs over summer (January to March) as opposed to autumn/winter. The damage threshold for black beetle larvae is approximately 20-30/m2 which is considerably lower than for grass-grub.\r\nPatches of yellowing tillers that pull easily from the pasture may become noticeable in autumn and spring. This is a sign of adult feeding. Adults may feed on roots or on the base of plants at soil level. Any more than 10 adults/m2 in pasture are a concern but populations of 30/m2 have become common and they can reach as high as 95/m2. In maize 1-2 beetles/m2 in spring are sufficient to cause an economic loss.\r\nBoth larvae and adults can be particularly destructive to newly sown grasses.\r\nBeetles and larvae will also feed on brassica roots, maize, sweetcorn, kumara and strawberries. A series of dry summers and autumns since 2007/8 has contributed to higher than usual numbers of black beetle particularly on light soil types.\r\nPugging as a result of plant destruction can be a serious issue.\r\nDamage is generally more severe on dairy than on sheep and beef farms but occurs on all types.','There are few control options available for black beetle other than sowing resistant grasses. Ryegrasses containing the AR37 endophyte are the best option in black beetle prone areas but some protection will also be gained using Endo 5 or NEA2.  Wild type (or standard endophyte) also protects from black beetle feeding. Max P in tall fescue helps protect that grass.These endophyte fungi produce toxins that deter the adult black beetles from feeding and if the beetles cannot find alternative plants to feed on they will die before they can lay their eggs. The endophytes do not directly affect the larvae. AR1 infected ryegrasses ARE NOT protected from black beetle feeding. For endophyte selection seehttp://www.dairynz.co.nz/page/pageid/2145866515/Pasture.\r\nGrass type can affect beetle development. Grasses with high root levels of carbohydrate enable faster beetle maturation. These include paspalum, kikuyu and several other weed grasses. Eliminating these grasses from pasture will slow development and reduce the problem. Annual ryegrasses are good host plants for black beetle.\r\nNo chemicals are registered for control of larvae or adults in pasture. Imidacloprid is available as a seed coating.\r\nSowing insecticide treated seed can provide protection against adult beeles and assist seedling establishment. It will not protect against larvae and if beetle flights are prolonged the level of protection offered may not be enough. Sowing should be delayed until late February to avoid larval attack. To maximise the benefits of pasture renovation and of the endophyte containing grasses it is important that seed is sown into clean paddocks free of other grasses that the beetles can feed on. Any pasture renewal planned for autumn should be consistent with best practice guidelines, see:http://www.dairynz.co.nz/file/fileid/34881\r\nThe use of a break crop that is unfavourable to black beetle can provide a clean seed bed and aid establishment of new pasture. Brassicas, maize, legumes and chicory do not support full development of black beetle and can be used in pasture renovation programmes.'),(36,'pest','Black beetle adult','Heteronychus arator','Black beetle is a pest in northern North Island\r\nWarm years favour black beetle populations\r\nBoth beetles and larvae damage pasture, other agricultural and some horticultural crops\r\nLarvae cause damage to pasture in summer\r\nAdult beetles cause damage in autumn and spring','Black beetle is an African species but has been present in New Zealand for several decades.

They have large heads with very long antennae. They have wings and although they generally do not fly there are occasional mass flights when numbers are high. Females have a long ovipositor (egg-laying tube) which extends past and under the wings. The adult males “chirp”, by rubbing their wings together\r\nThere is just one generation a year but the life stages overlap. Eggs, which are white, ovoid-shaped, and about 0.3 cm long are laid singly, but loosely clustered, about 1 cm deep in damp soil. A single female cricket is capable of laying up to 2000 eggs between mid-February and early May. After hatching the nymphs take 2-4 months to mature into adults and then live for 2-3 months. The nymphs pass through 9-10 stages and resemble small adults but do not have wings, or in the case of females, ovipositors, until the 8th and 9th stages. Overwintering occurs as eggs. The smaller nymphs live and hide within pasture and this makes them difficult to detect. Larger nymphs and adults tend to shelter in cracks in soil or under cow pats and litter\r\nAlthough found throughout the North Island and milder coastal regions of the South Island they are usually only economically important in Northland, Auckland, Waikato, Bay of Plenty, Hawkes Bay, Taranaki and Manawatu. Black field crickets, especially the nymphs, are often confused with several species of much smaller native crickets. These only grow to about 1 cm and crickets larger than this are likely to be black field crickets. Native crickets are also active during the day and when disturbed will jump and be easily seen. In contrast black field crickets are active at night and if disturbed during the day will run for shelter and remain hidden. When threatened they will jump quickly away. Black field crickets can also be identified by a distinctive white band around their middle.','Impact on pasture\r\nBlack field crickets are generally pests only in northern areas of New Zealand. Their significance is increased in long dry periods and in soils that crack in during these periods. They feed most commonly on the leaves and germinating seeds of grasses, especially ryegrasses, but also eat legumes and weeds\r\nTheir feeding, and the type of damage they cause, can be categorised into three types:\r\nGrazing, where adults and the larger nymphs compete with stock for food. Over one hectare 2 crickets/m2 will consume the equivalent of one sheep. In plague seasons as many as 20-40 crickets/m2 frequently occur and can cause losses of 30kg DM/ha/day. In dairy pasture an average density of 25 crickets/m2 can be responsible for 2000 kg DM/ha/yr lost production\r\nDuring long dry periods the growing crowns of grasses are attacked often killing the plants and leaving the soil open to weed invasion\r\nSown, or self sown seedlings, may be destroyed by cricket feeding.\r\nThe potential for long term pasture damage and unseen losses makes early detection of crickets important. In areas prone to cricket damage the density can be quickly assessed by pouring a weak detergent solution (4 mls dishwashing liquid in 10 L water) over a known area of pasture. This will “flush” crickets out of cracks in the soil and make it easy to count them and determine their density. A density of 10/m2 is considered economically damaging.','Chemical control\r\nPopulations of more than 10 crickets/m2 are economically damaging. Control of black field crickets is usually by using grain baits coated with an insecticide (maldison). For more information consult the New Zealand Agrichemical Manual or an agrichemical company representative.'),(38,'pest','Clover flea, clover springtail, lucerne flea','Sminthurus viridis','Found throughout New Zealand\r\nUsually only a pest in Northland, South Auckland, Waikato and the Bay of Plenty\r\nSmall (>1 mm) yellow/green insects that jump when disturbed\r\nClover flea will feed on a range of legumes but white clover is the preferred food plant\r\nDamage can also be caused to lucerne, subterranean clover and when numbers are very high to grasses\r\nDamage is caused primarily in spring and autumn.','Clover flea is a misleading term as they are not fleas at all and indeed may not even be insects. They are a type of Collembola commonly known as globular springtails. This name derives from them appearing to consist of 2 attached balls (hence globular) and a specialised appendage which enables them to spring very quickly into the air (hence springtail and flea). The same animal is also known as lucerne flea. Clover flea is present throughout New Zealand only reaching pest status in localised areas of the North Island – dairy pastures in parts of Northland, South Auckland, Waikato and the Bay of Plenty\r\nAfter mating female clover fleas lay their eggs in batches of 2 – 40. These usually hatch after 26 – 42 days depending on temperature. Eggs laid in late spring take longer to hatch and will not do so until they have undergone periods of dry conditions followed by declining soil temperatures and increasing soil temperatures. This avoids the eggs hatching during dry summer months when food may be scarce. After hatching the young clover flea passes through 7 moults increasing in size each time until they reach a maximum size of about 3mm. Females tend to be larger than males but both are yellow green in colour with brown mottling on their backs.

Damage can also be caused to lucerne, subterranean clover and when numbers are very high to grasses\r\nDamage to clover results from young nymphs eating small holes in the leaves, giving the leaves a speckled appearance, while feeding from older nymphs and adults produces window like openings in the leaves.

Applications should be applied when damage is first noticed or when high numbers of clover fleas are observed. At times repeat applications may be necessary to achieve good control. In this situation the most cost effective approach can be to use diflubenzuron in conjunction with another insecticide\r\nRegistered insecticides (active ingredients) for use against clover flea in pasture or clover seed crops are: chlorpyrifos, diazinon, diflubenzuron, dimethoate, fenitrothion and maldison\r\nConsult your farm consultant, industry rep or the New Zealand Agricultural Manual for more information about chemical control'),(39,'pest','Clover Root Weevil','Sitona obsoletus','Major pest of clovers, both red and white cultivars but white clover often most severely attacked\r\nFound throughout New Zealand\r\nAdults feed on clover foliage leaving distinctive notches on leaf margins\r\nLarvae are most the damaging stage destroying clover roots and root nodules\r\nInfested pastures become clover deficient.\r\nBiological control has significantly reduced impact of this pest','Clover root weevil (CRW) adults are mahogany-brown, 4-6 mm long, with a short, blunt nose. It can be difficult to tell adult CRW apart from other weevils that can also be found in pasture. Adult weevils are most abundant in autumn and spring. They lay their eggs on the pasture surface and when these hatch the larvae move into the soil seeking food and shelter. These are legless, creamy white grubs, 1-6 mm long with a brown head. They may be found by digging into the root zone under clover plants. Larvae are present throughout the year but are more abundant in late spring and late autumn. The larvae are generally much smaller than grass-grub larvae, which can be common in pastures, and they lack the distinctive C-shape that characterise grass grub\r\nClover root weevil has been present in New Zealand since at least 1994 but was not discovered until 1996. By 2006 it was present throughout the North Island and by 2015 throughout the South Island. The combination of a favourable environment, lack of competition for an abundant food resource, high reproductive capability of the weevil and a lack of natural enemies inevitably meant clover root weevil was going to become one of New Zealand\\’s most damaging pests of clover.\r\nThere are two generations a year with adult populations peaking in early and late summer in the North Island and summer and autumn in the South Island. The adults can live for several months with the females laying up to several hundred eggs. Young larvae mainly feed on clover root nodules. As they mature they move onto the roots and stolons. Adults feed on clover leaves producing characteristic notching of leaf margins. Dispersal by flight occurs during the summer and autumn with the proportion of adults having flight or reproductive capability dependent on prevailing climatic and pasture conditions\r\nWhile clover is abundant and summer rainfall high or irrigation used most weevils remain reproductive and stay in the pastures they lived in as larvae. When there is drought and clover is limited a large proportion of weevils stop being reproductive and instead develop flight muscles and disperse to new locations. Once they have located a suitable site the flight muscles atrophy and the weevils again become reproductive. Clover root weevil is a very proficient hitch-hiker in hay and on vehicles.','Feeding by adult CRW causes distinctive semi-circular notching on the edges of clover leaves. These notches are symmetrical and uniform, unlike the jagged or irregular damage caused by other pasture pests, such as slugs and caterpillars. While this damage can appear serious, generally, it does not cause significant damage in established pastures. Adult feeding can however, kill large numbers of clover seedlings in newly sown pasture\r\nAlthough adult feeding damage is most noticeable, feeding by larvae is more damaging. The young larvae feed on root nodules and later the roots. This reduces the plant’s ability to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and reduces plant growth. A reduction in nitrogen fixed also impacts on the growth of other pasture plants and leads to an increased requirement for nitrogen fertiliser to be applied. Prior to the release of the biocontrol agent moderate populations of larvae (approx. 300/m2) have reduced clover production by 35% (1000kg DM/ha) annually with greatest losses occurring in spring. Without additional nitrogen it has been estimated a typical Waikato dairy farm would suffer a 16% reduction in net profit. An extra 180 kg N/ha was required on some farms to alleviate the impact of the weevil. During invasive periods larval numbers as high as 1800/m2 have been recorded. With the establishment of biological control numbers are now usually much less. Left unchecked MPI estimated clover root weevil could have cost New Zealand between $200m and $1b per annum.\r\nA cost: benefit analysis undertaken in 2015, has shown that for Southland alone the impact of the parasitoid wasp in supressing CRW was worth $2.3m pa for beef and lamb farms and $7 M pa for dairy farms','Insecticides\r\nDuring pasture establishment application of a foliar insecticide can be used close to seedling emergence to control adults and provide a window in which clover plants may establish before re-invasion by the weevil occurs. Seed coatings do not provide adequate protection against this pest and should not be relied on\r\nClover root weevil is difficult to control with insecticides in established pastures. Because the larvae live in the soil and are relatively immobile, and because New Zealand soils are high in organic matter which binds up insecticide, getting an insecticide to them is difficult to achieve. The adults are very mobile and although they can be killed, pastures are rapidly reinvaded from surrounding areas.\r\nInsecticides are harmful to the biocontrol agent\r\nClover and pasture management\r\nClover root weevil is dependent on clover for its survival. When pastures are severely damaged destroying the remaining clover with a selective herbicide and/or cultivation followed by a farrow period leaving the pasture clover free for 6-8 months can cause the weevil population to die off and provide a clean pasture in which clover can be re-established. Drilling clover seed into a damaged pasture without removing the older clover plants should not be attempted as the weevils prefer seedlings and will concentrate their feeding on them. Biological control will not prevent seedling damage.\r\nEstablishment of clover seedlings at sowing can be improved by utilising break crops rather than straight pasture to pasture rotations. A brassica or an all grass break crop will provide a clean paddock to which clover can be re-introduced. Clover management to maintain healthy plants is important. A healthy plant can tolerate more feeding pressure than an unhealthy plant. Adequate fertiliser should be used to keep clover growing in the presence of the weevil and to keep other pasture plants, which would normally benefit from clover nitrogen fixation, healthy as well. When clover is put under pressure by clover root weevil not only do the larvae consume nodules but the plants respond to the stress by reducing nodule production. In such instances compensatory nitrogen should be applied frequently to infested pastures in small amounts. Clover should not be put under stress by other factors, do not overgraze and avoid pugging of soil over winter.\r\nA parasitoid wasp for biological control\r\nIn 2006 AgResearch introduced a small parasitic wasp (Microctonus aethiopoides) as a biological control agent against clover root weevil. This wasp was released at numerous locations in both islands and is now very widely distributed. This biocontrol agent will not eliminate clover root weevil or the damage it causes, but it has reduced the impact of the weevil and in most locations the impact of the weevil has been negated by the biocontrol agent. However, there will always be some years and some areas where the biocontrol agent temporarily losses effectiveness either because of climatic events, use of insecticides that kill the wasp or pasture renewal events.

Of these, only the grey field slug (Deroceras reticulatum) can be considered a significant agricultural pest. Other species are occasionally encountered in agricultural systems, but are never numerous.\r\nLife cycle\r\nGrey field slugs mate and lay eggs all year round, but most eggs are laid in early spring and autumn.  Groups of up to 50 clear 2 mm gelatinous eggs are laid in sheltered moist places.  Young slugs begin feeding immediately after hatching. Slug development is related to temperature, and sexual maturity is reached between three and nine months of age.  Slugs function as males when first sexually mature and as females later.  Cross fertilisation is usual, although self fertilisation may occur.  Grey field slugs can live for up to 13 months, and produce as many as 300 eggs.\r\nFeeding\r\nThe grey field slug feeds mostly on plant leaves but will also feed on other plant organs and occasionally dead invertebrates and other slugs. Slugs feed by rasping away plant tissue. Characteristically, major veins and the lower epidermis of plant leaves are left intact giving the leaf a “windowed” appearance.\r\nActivity\r\nSlugs are active throughout the year, but during very dry or frosty weather they cease feeding and move down into the soil or shelter under debris. Not all slugs within a population will be active at the same time. Slugs are most active on still humid nights when soil is wet\r\nMoisture is critical and forms 80% of slugs’ body weight when fully hydrated. Large quantities of moisture are used to produce mucous which is used in locomotion, to prevent desiccation and as a defence mechanism when attacked by predators. They can absorb atmospheric and soil moisture through their skin but are vulnerable to desiccation. They avoid climatic conditions and substrates which would dry them out.','Slugs damage a wide range of agricultural and horticultural crops. They have their greatest impact during seedling establishment as they feed on seedlings of all agricultural crops. Conventional cultivation kills slugs, and crops established following cultivation seldom suffer from slug damage\r\nHowever slugs are a danger to direct drilled crops. The drill slits formed during direct drilling favour slug survival, and focus their feeding on seeds and emerging seedlings. When high numbers of slugs are present, establishing crops can be devastated overnight. Numbers as low as 15/m2 can cause significant damage. Slugs are generally more of a problem on heavy soils and in wet areas but damage is not restricted to these situations.\r\nDetection\r\nIt is very difficult to accurately estimate the number of slugs present in paddocks. The mottled appearance of grey field slugs camouflages them amongst rotting plant foliage and makes them difficult to see. Slugs can not actively burrow, but their soft flexible bodies enable them to utilise cracks and the burrows of other animals in the soil, and they can be found 20 cm, or deeper, in the soil. The bases of large or clump forming plants are also favoured sheltering spots\r\nFeeding damage in established plants is often the best indication of slug presence and potential damage to new crops.  Wet sacks placed in paddocks can provide a rough estimate of whether high numbers of slugs are present, but this and similar methods are often affected by environmental and climatic factors and should not be relied on.  Details of more accurate (but time consuming) sampling methods such as defined area trapping and turf immersion techniques can be obtained from AgResearch\r\nAfter direct drilling, slugs can be counted easily by opening the drill slits. More than two slugs/m of drill row are likely to cause damage.\r\nIf the right farming practices are carried out it is not necessary to know how many slugs are present.','Stock management\r\nExcellent slug control can be achieved using stock prior to direct drilling. Grazing the old vegetation hard kills slugs, and provides actively growing leafy material which will allow better herbicide activity. Grazing with 500 ewes/ha for three consecutive nights, 300 ewes/ha for five nights or 120 cows/ha for three nights, will give up to 90% control. Stock grazing closes cracks and crevices in the soil, trapping slugs either below the soil surface, from where they can not burrow out, or on the soil surface where they are exposed to adverse climatic factors (sun and wind) and vertebrate predation. Stock trampling also directly kills large numbers of slugs, especially if most of the population is active. Farmers practising rotational grazing, or similar stock management, routinely reduce slug numbers in their pastures. Lush pastures, those allowed to grow rank, and those with thick turf mats, such as found in browntop swards, often harbour potentially damaging numbers of slugs.\r\nDrill type and coulter selection\r\nThe severity of slug damage will be influenced by the type of drill used, coulter design and soil conditions. Slug survival and access to seeds and seedlings is enhanced by open drill slits and when seeds are not covered by soil. Till seeders and rotodrills offer more protection to the seeds and less shelter to slugs than triple disc type drills but will not totally prevent slug damage. Winged coulters provide more favourable habitats for slugs than coulters that only create a vertical slot. Soils which crumble to cover the seed and close the drill slits favour slugs least. Don’t select your coulter with only slug control in mind. Remember, it takes more than coulter selection to control slugs, and more than slug control to successfully establish a paddock.\r\nCultural practices\r\nTrash and crop residues left on the soil surface provide refuges and egg laying sites for slugs.  Eliminate them before drilling. Cultivation kills slugs and as a general rule the finer the tilth and the deeper the cultivation the greater the slug mortality achieved.\r\nMolluscicides\r\nMolluscicide baits are dry and must absorb moisture to make them palatable and attractive to slugs.  Usually sufficient moisture is absorbed from the soil. Baits eventually become unattractive, and therefore ineffective, as the grain or bran base used breaks down.For maximum effectiveness, baits should be broadcast evenly over paddocks prior to sowing. Because the entire slug population may not be active and feeding when baits are applied, and because, even though the baits contain attractants, some slugs will not come in contact with them, repeat applications of molluscicide baits provide higher levels of control than a single application. Drilling baits with the seed is also an option but baits tend to break down more quickly in drill slits than on the soil surface, and results are not as good as when baits are broadcast\r\nIf damage appears after sowing, application of molluscicide baits is the only control option. Discuss your bait needs and application techniques with your local chemical or seed rep.'),(42,'pest','Grass-grub, brown beetle larvae','Costelytra zealandica','Grass-grub larvae\r\nGrass-grub larvae are soil dwelling grey/white grubs up to 15 mm long with tan coloured heads\r\nTypically found lying in a C shape\r\nFeed on a the roots of many pasture species and other plants\r\nDamage occurs in discrete patches in pasture\r\nThese initially appear yellower than surrounding pasture and plants are pulled easiliy from the ground\r\nPatches feel soft underfoot and are easily pugged.','The immature larval stages of Costelytra zealandica, generally known as grass-grub, are New Zealand’s most important native pasture pest. The adult grass-grub beetles, sometimes called brown beetles, are shiny tan/brown, about 10 mm long, and fly at dusk in spring and early summer. They are generally not seen during the day but fly after dusk and are often attracted to lights in large numbers. They have two flight phases, the first is a mating flight and occurs very soon after the beetles emerge from the soil, the second consists of feeding flights and may occur for 2-3 weeks\r\nThe beetles live for a few weeks. During this phase the beetles mate and the females lay their eggs 100 to 150 mm under the soil. Each female lays about 30 eggs. On hatching the larvae feed on roots of a wide range of plants. As they grow they pass through three larval stages. Development from egg to adult usually takes 1 year but under severe environmental conditions development of some grubs may be extended over two years. Usually both one and two-year life cycle grubs occur together. The two-year life cycle is found more commonly in Otago and Southland than elsewhere and is in response to cool soil conditions. Drought may also cause the grubs to enter a two-year life cycle. Root damage results mainly when grubs reach the third stage. For one-year life cycle grubs this is in autumn and early winter. Those grubs entering a two-year cycle do not reach the third stage until spring/summer causing damage in summer when sufficient numbers are present\r\nSeveral other beetle species resemble grass-grub beetles and their feeding can appear identical. The larvae of such beetles are very similar and expert advice may be required to correctly identify them.\r\nNatural population regulation\r\nGrass-grub populations are regulated by several diseases which can only persist if grass-grubs are present. Grass-grub outbreaks, and therefore damage to pastures, usually occur when the grass-grub/disease association is disrupted. Disruption happens when grass-grub numbers are dramatically reduced and there is no renewal of disease organisms in the soil. Commonly this is a result of cultivation but may also be due to drought and occasionally insecticide use. The low disease levels in the population allow grass-grub numbers to increase causing pasture damage. The disease organisms build up in response to increasing grass-grub numbers but there is a lag period before they again regulate grass-grub to below damaging levels. The outbreak most often occurs 2-3 years after the disruption so damage to young pastures, established using cultivation, typically occurs in their second or third winter. Pasture renovation by direct drilling favours retention of grass-grub diseases in the soil reducing likelihood of damage. When the grass-grub outbreaks are the result of drought, pastures of any age can be affected.','Larvae\r\nImmediately after hatching young grass-grub feed on plant roots and soil organic matter. As they grow they focus on living plant roots but can survive on dying or dead roots for extended periods. Larvae feed on roots of a range of plants. Although larvae in the second stage can cause damage it is usually third stage grubs that do so. Most pasture grasses and clovers are suitable food plants although some, such as tall fescue and cocksfoot, show greater tolerance to feeding than others. Cereals and brassica crops are often attacked and fodder beet is also at risk. Larvae also feed on a wide range of plants of horticultural and ornamental significance\r\nGrass-grubs occur in aggregations and cause damage in patches of pasture. Within these patches the density of grubs can be very high and cause localised destruction of plants even though the over all density of grubs in a paddock may be low. When the patches become extensive, either in number or size, the amount of damge caused increases. In established pasture a density of around 100 grubs/m2 measured over the whole pasture is largely undamaging although some damage patches will be evident. At an average density of 200/m2 and above damage will be noticable, production affected and large areas of pasture opened up for weed invasion with a subsequent loss of pasture quality. In some areas, particularly Otago and Southland, populations can greatly exceed this level\r\nIn pasture when grass-grub numbers are high the turf may feel soft underfoot, and can be rolled back as a result of lack of roots anchoring the plants to the soil. Patches of heavily infested pasture appear yellow relative to undamaged pasture and plants are easily pulled from the soil by stock. Damaged areas are easily pugged. Grass-grub feeding reduces plant productivity and survival and when most severe pastures may need to be renovated. The density of grubs necessary to cause damage varies between regions and is related to soil temperatures and soil friability.','Measuring damage by larvae\r\nAwareness and early recognition of damage will avoid severe pasture loss and prolong pasture life. Assess grass-grub numbers as early as possible. Options for detecting damaging levels include:\r\nDigging – from mid-February. Dig 200 x 200 mm spade squares to a depth of 50 mm deep and hand sort soil to find grubs. Take at least 10 per paddock. In February/March most grubs will be small (less than 10 mm). By April the grubs will be larger but some small ones may still be present. Grubs are usually found in the root zone of the plants but may be deeper in the soil under very dry conditions\r\nEarly warning strip – Autumn. Apply insecticide to a marked strip (2 x 20 m) of pasture in an area where it can be easily seen. If strip appears “greener” than surrounding pasture after 3-4 weeks a pest is causing damage. Dig and sort the soil to determine if pest is grass-grub.\r\nDensities greater than an average of 8 larvae per spade square (200/m2) will cause damage.'),(43,'pest','Great white butterfly','Pieris brassicae','Currently only found in Nelson where an eradication attempt is underway\r\nPotential to spread throughout New Zealand\r\nPest of all brassica crops, and also found on nasturtiums.\r\nButterflies look similar to cabbage white butterfly, but are 1.5 to 2 times bigger\r\nEggs are small and yellow, and are laid in clusters of 30-100 on top or bottom of leaf\r\nCaterpillars have yellow and black markings, and feed together in clusters.','Discovered in Nelson in May 2010 and currently (December 2013) the target of an eradication attempt\r\nAdult butterflies are strong fliers, so could spread outside Nelson\r\nThey fly on warm sunny days from early spring to late autumn\r\nFemales lay eggs in batches of 30-100 on brassica leaves, and can lay up to 500 eggs in their lifetime\r\nCaterpillars feed in groups, often stripping all the leaves from a plant before dispersing to fresh plants\r\nYoung small caterpillars are yellow with shiny black heads, then they develop black spots as they get older.

The flightless surface dwelling adults occur from late spring through to early winter. All adult whitefringed weevils in New Zealand are female with reproduction occurring via parthenogenesis.\r\nWhile adult weevils can potentially lay over 1000 eggs their diet plays an important role in their overall fecundity.  When fed ryegrass only 20-30 eggs are laid but with legumes such as lucerne and clover they will lay 300-400 and when fed peanut leaves they will lay over 1000 eggs.\r\nThe adults begin laying eggs 5 to 25 days after emergence from the pupa.  Eggs are initially milky-white when first laid but change to dull light yellow. They are very small (<1 mm diameter) and laid in groups of 12 -60 in a gelatinous mass that hardens after drying causing the eggs to adhere to soil and litter, making them difficult if not impossible to see.  The eggs hatch about 2 weeks after rain or irrigation.\r\nThe larvae have 11 larval growth stages (instars) all of which are found in the soil. They are legless, have a grey-white body and large black jaws that are clearly visible.  The yellow brown head is usually unable to be seen as it is retracted into the body.  The first instar larvae do not feed but are able to survive for several months before moulting to the second instar which commences feeding on plant roots.   Larval development takes between 8 and 24 months with fully grown larvae reaching about 13 × 6 mm in size. These are the most damaging stage.  The larvae can feed on a wide range of plants and there is some evidence that larvae grow more quickly when feeding on a preferred host such as white clover.\r\nPupae can be found from late September-early April in oval chambers 5–15 cm deep in the soil. Pupae are white, 10-12 mm long and turn brown just before adults emerge.','In New Zealand, larvae have been recorded damaging lucerne, pastures, forest seedlings, horticultural crops and grape vines.

Normally 99% of the seeds in the soil seedbank are found in the top 2.5 cm of soil\r\nCan reproduce by either cross- or self-fertilization, and some seeds are produced in unopened flowers near the base of the flower stem\r\nChilean needle grass may have the potential to spread to 15 million ha nationwide, mainly on the East Coast of both islands.

It is found on dry open faces and ridges, pastures, crops, roadsides and waste places\r\nDrought, overgrazing and pasture pests such as grass grub and porina open up the pasture making it easier for thistles to establish\r\nNodding thistle spread quickly across New Zealand in the 1950s, possibly as the result of a series of dry summers.\r\nLife cycle\r\nSome nodding thistle plants flower in the first year and have an annual life-cycle, others have a biennial life cycle, flowering only in their second year\r\nMost plants germinate in autumn, form a rosette during winter, then bolt (send up a tall flower stalk) in spring, and flower, seed and die in summer\r\nSeedlings that germinate in autumn are more likely to survive and produce flowers\r\nGermination usually occurs in bare patches; pasture cover suppresses germination\r\nStrong pasture competition reduces thistle growth rates and increases their mortality. Small thistles are more vulnerable to damage than large ones\r\nThistle infestations are worse after droughts; most nodding thistles germinate within two months after a drought: a summer drought nearly always leads to a ‘thistle year’ the next summer\r\nEach nodding thistle plant can produce from 7000 to 30,000 seeds, but some seeds will not be viable\r\nStock (especially goats) may eat flowering thistles and destroy the seeds, but will only eat them when they are flowering\r\nMost seeds are not carried far by the wind, and most fall within 20 m of the parent plant\r\nIf seeds become buried 50 mm deep in the soil, over 40% of the seeds may be viable 4 years later.

On one study, the growth rate of sheep grazing pastures with high thistle numbers (2+ thistles per m2) was 30% lower than sheep grazing pastures with low thistle numbers (0.5 thistles per m2) at the same stocking rate\r\nSheep growth rates can also be reduced indirectly through herbicide damage to clovers when thistles are sprayed.','The best returns from thistle control come from managing the most productive land\r\nRelatively low returns for sheep and beef make thistle control marginal in hill country, except after a drought\r\nHigh livestock value and gross margins increase the value of the pasture and make weed control more worthwhile\r\nMany principles which apply to nodding thistle and variegated thistles are also relevant for other thistles such as Scotch and winged thistles.\r\nGrazing management\r\nGoats will eat and control thistles, but only when the plants are flowering\r\nCareful grazing in autumn, spring and summer to ensure strong pasture cover, especially in autumn, will give most effective control of the weed\r\nPasture damage caused by overgrazing or pugging encourage thistles and other weeds.\r\nPasture species/cultivars\r\nDense, vigorous pastures stop thistles from establishing and reduce their growth and survival\r\nPasture cover is most important in autumn\r\nWhere new improved cocksfoot varieties perform well they may to keep thistles out.\r\nChemical control\r\nThe most cost-effective control is achieved by spraying young thistles in late autumn or in winter after drought\r\nThistles are most susceptible to herbicides when small, that is in autumn and winter\r\nBlanket spraying small thistles (up to six leaf stage) in autumn and winter is less damaging to clover than spraying in spring\r\nGrazing before spraying in spring will reduce the amount of clover leaf present and reduce clover damage\r\nIn spring and summer, spot spraying or weed wipers can be used for larger thistles, although clover may also be damaged\r\nCheck the tap root diameter before spraying; two year old plants may have small rosettes but a large root system with a larger diameter tap root. They look similar above ground to one year old plants, but two year old plants need more herbicide to kill them\r\nFor low use rates, or to use clover-safe herbicides like MCPB: root diameter below the crown must be smaller than a five cent piece\r\nIn some areas, thistles have developed resistance to phenoxy herbicides such as MCPA, MCPB, 2,4-D; use non-phenoxy herbicides such as metsulfuron-methyl, clopyralid or glyphosate to control them.'),(50,'weed','Oxtongue','Helminthotheca echioides','Tall, stiff, erect plant when in flower, with yellow, dandelion-like flowers up to 25 mm across\r\nLeaves have raised spots with short, hooked bristles, giving the leaves a very rough feeling (like an ox’s tongue, hence the name)\r\nThe plant forms a large rosette before flowering\r\nFlower stems are stiff, erect, branched, with rough bristles and small leaves\r\nFruits are achenes 3 mm long, each with a white, feathery, umbrella-shaped pappus\r\nCommon on roadsides, especially in the Whanganui/Manawatu area, and in central Hawkes Bay.','Origin\r\nNative to southern Europe, south-west Asia and North Africa\r\nIn New Zealand it is often conspicuous on roadsides, but also occurs on arable and pasture land and in waste place\r\nOccurs in all parts of North and South Islands, from scarce to abundant\r\nIntroduced to New Zealand, either by accident or as a potentially useful plant, sometime before 1871.

It is also found on Stewart and Chatham Islands\r\nSweet briar grows in tussock grassland and poor pastures (particularly with stony ground and little rain) where competition is limited\r\nThe plant is associated with extensively grazed grassland and light scrubland.\r\nImpact on pasture\r\nSweet briar is very competitive once established, can prevent other plants from growing near it, and livestock are deterred from grazing close to it\r\nUsually grows in good potential forage areas and can obstruct the free passage of livestock.','Grazing management\r\nGoats can effectively control sweet briar but must be fenced in close to it to prevent selective browsing.\r\nOther methods\r\nCan be discouraged by planting competitive pasture species which will help prevent its establishment\r\nHand grubbing, bulldozing and root raking can be used to remove established plants.\r\nChemical control\r\nWhen economically viable, metsulfuron, glyphosate or triclopyr + picloram can control sweet briar, but re-establishment may be an issue\r\nSpot treatment with spray or prills, or cut stump treatment with picloram gels are all good methods for controlling plants in pasture.');
